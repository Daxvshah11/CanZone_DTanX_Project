What is CanZone ?

Canzone in Italian literally means "Songs"!

For all your favourites ranging from Classical to Pop.... Rock to Jazz.... Bollywood to Indie.... and everything in between.... CanZone is your one-stop destination!

It provides the users a place where they "CAN" go into their "ZONE"!!



As creators of the website:

	- we have took into consideration the UI/UX of the website at each & every step while building it from scratch
		
	- we have managed to keep the website truly vibrant & colorful while also keeping it decent enough by not over-doing any of the effects
	
	- we tried to keep the text sizes as much "OPTIMAL" as possible on all pages in order to make it a good reading experience for the users
	
	- even smallest shades of color contrasts have been considered by us leading to being very picky about the background accents & images for all pages
	
	- we have kept the footer such that it is clearly visible commonly on all the pages while at the same time, does not attract too much of attention
	
	- selection of fonts has been a very generic choice that would suit the mass rather than being a personal choice by any of us
	
	- sizes of different sections, divisions & images were well-thought over by both of us such that it provides a good User Experience (UX)
	
	- User Interface (UI) has been kept as simple as possible rather than making it too fancy or complex so that it appeals to all categories of users
	
	
	
How to access the website for evaluations ?

	- In order to open the Home page of the website, you need to run the HTML file named as HomePage.html in the "src/" folder on any brwoser of your choice
	
	- As soon as you open the Home page, from there, all other pages are accessible either directly or indirectly (via other pages)
	
	- The inter-connection of pages has been already established within the HTML scripts of all the pages
